1. Creating separate CSS files for each component. This approach follows the principles of encapsulation,
where styles are scoped to a specific component and do not leak or interfere with other components.

2. Will be good to use destructuring. This can make code cleaner and more readable.

Example: In WatchLater component we have this:
         const state = useSelector((state) => state)
         const { watchLater } = state

   After we use "watchLaterMovies" everywhere in this way: watchLater.watchLaterMovies

   We can use this structure:
   const { watchLaterMovies } = useSelector((state) => state.watchLater);

   (I fixed it for Movie, Starred, WatchLater components also)

3. For YoutubePlayer we use "react-player" which bundle size is 18.8kB, would try to find something lighter(for example "react-youtube" 5.9kB).

4. I prefer use CSS classes or styles for setting CSS properties instead of inline styles.
It makes code more maintainable.

Example: <div style={{ padding: "30px" }}>
            <h6>no trailer available. Try another movie</h6>
         </div>

5. Exposing API keys publicly is a significant security risk. In our project we can fix it using packages like dotenv.

6. We have this function in our project:
    const myClickHandler = (e) => {
            if (!e) var e = window.event
            e.cancelBubble = true
            if (e.stopPropagation) e.stopPropagation()
            e.target.parentElement.parentElement.classList.remove('opened')
        }

 This function is not good and readable(and function name):
       - "window.event" and "e.cancelBubble" are not commonly used in modern JavaScript
       - unnecessary check for !e (e parameter will always be present when the click event occurs)

 This is more readable:
       const myClickHandler = (e) => {
               e.stopPropagation();
               const parentElement = e.target.parentElement.parentElement;
               parentElement.classList.remove('opened');
           }

7. But also in Movie.jsx component we have this button:
   <button type="button" className="close" onClick={(e) => myClickHandler(e)} aria-label="Close">
       <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
   </button>

The presence of this element is irrelevant, if it is intended for the movie modal X. We can remove it.

8. We can also delete the closeCard() function. It performs no function.

9. It would be great if Prettier & Eslint were added to the project.

10. When using map(), we pass id as key, which we have to make sure is unique.

    Example: In Movies component we pass movie.id like key, but in console we get error(Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop)

        {movies.movies?.map((movie) => {
                        return (
                            <Movie
                                movie={movie}
                                key={movie.id}
                                viewTrailer={viewTrailer}
                                closeCard={closeCard}
                            />
                        )
                    })}

We can solve this problem using a unique identifier(for example key={movie.id+movie.poster_path}).

11. In Movie component we have such as part:
    <span className="btn-star" data-testid="starred-link" onClick={() =>
      dispatch(starMovie({
         id: movie.id,
         overview: movie.overview,
         release_date: movie.release_date?.substring(0, 4),
         poster_path: movie.poster_path,
         title: movie.title
      })
    )}>

We need to make sure, that "movie" is not null or undefined, I suggest to do the following:
   const { id, overview, release_date, poster_path, title } = movie || {}

12. The functions that are part of the useEffect and depend on them, or functions that we pass to Child components for example,
wrap useCallback hooks with.

Example: viewTrailer & getMovie functions

and the components(Movies, Starred, WatchLater in my case) that are passed to take those functions in the memo()
(While useCallback can optimize specific function references, memo optimizes the entire component's rendering)

13. The searchMovies() function needs a review, it's misspelled(we won't need to use Link here I think:
        <Link to="/" onClick={(e) => searchMovies('')} className="search-link" >
          <input type="search" data-testid="search-movies"
            onKeyUp={(e) => searchMovies(e.target.value)}
            className="form-control rounded"
            placeholder="Search movies..."
            aria-label="Search movies"
            aria-describedby="search-addon"
            />
        </Link>
)

14. And it would be great to write test cases(unfortunately I don't have experience).
